# Pyriodic
## What is Pyriodic ?
### A work in progress
Pyriodic is, at this point, just a project, with lots of ideas and only a few code. The project is to create a simple interface to display the periodic table in the terminal. 
#### The Interface
The objective is to write a beautiful and interactive table with `ncurses`. For now, the interface is a basic CLI interface.
#### The Data
At first, the idea of a database seemed good to me. However, I think the project needs to be light, so a database isn't the solution. It'll get removed in future updates. For now, I'm working on how to use `json` and `requests` modules to use the [neelpatel05 API](https://github.com/neelpatel05/periodic-table-api), it seems reliable.
