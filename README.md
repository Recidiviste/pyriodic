# Pyriodic

## What is Pyriodic ?

### A work in progress
Pyriodic is, at this point, just a project, with lots of ideas and only a few code. The project is to create a simple interface to display the periodic table in the terminal.

#### The Interface
For now, the interface is simply a CLI interface. When it'll be more develloped, I'll add the details about it.

#### The Data
For now, I'm working on how to use `json` and `requests` modules to use the [neelpatel05 API](https://github.com/neelpatel05/periodic-table-api-go), it seems reliable.
